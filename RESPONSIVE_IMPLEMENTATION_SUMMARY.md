  - `ResponsiveGrid`: Dynamic grid system with mobile/tablet/desktop breakpoints
  - `ResponsiveText`: Typography component with size and weight variants
  - `ResponsiveSection`: Section wrapper with spacing and background options
  - `ResponsiveCard`: Card component with hover states and padding variants
  - `ResponsiveStack`: Vertical layout component with gap and alignment options
  - `ResponsiveFlex`: Horizontal layout component with full flexbox control

### Step 9: Comprehensive Testing Implementation
- **Development Server:** Running on `http://localhost:3003`
- **Testing Scope:**
  - Mobile devices (320px - 768px)
  - Tablet devices (768px - 1024px)
  - Desktop devices (1024px+)
  - Touch interactions and hover states
  - Accessibility compliance (focus states, reduced motion)

### Step 10: Final Validation & Performance
- **Performance Optimizations:**
  - Image lazy loading with proper `loading="lazy"`
  - Responsive image sizing with `sizes` attribute
  - Reduced motion preferences respected
  - Touch-optimized interactions
  - Accessibility improvements with ARIA labels

## üé® Design System Improvements

### Typography Scale
```css
.text-responsive-sm   /* text-sm md:text-base */
.text-responsive-md   /* text-base md:text-lg */
.text-responsive-lg   /* text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl */
.text-responsive-xl   /* text-xl md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl xl:text-4xl */
```

### Grid System
```css
.grid-responsive-1         /* grid-cols-1 */
.grid-responsive-2         /* grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 */
.grid-responsive-3         /* grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 */
.grid-responsive-projects  /* grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 */
```

### Touch Targets
```css
.touch-target       /* min-h-[44px] min-w-[44px] */
.touch-target-small /* min-h-[40px] min-w-[40px] */
```

## üì± Mobile-First Approach

### Breakpoints Strategy
- **Mobile:** 320px - 767px (primary focus)
- **Tablet:** 768px - 1023px (intermediate)
- **Desktop:** 1024px+ (enhancement)

### Key Mobile Optimizations
1. **Touch Interactions:** Minimum 44px touch targets
2. **Typography:** Scalable text that remains readable across devices
3. **Navigation:** Simplified mobile menu with clear hierarchy
4. **Forms:** Prevention of iOS zoom with `font-size: 16px`
5. **Images:** Proper sizing and lazy loading
6. **Animations:** Respect for `prefers-reduced-motion`
